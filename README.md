# Overview

High-performance, multidimensional arrays in modern C++.

# Immediate TODO

## Iterator Module

- Instead of incrementing the total step count, increment only the innermost
dimension. Recursively check whether the next dimension has reached its maximum
extent, and increment it.
- Consider implement `unchecked_` variants of the increment/decrement functions;
these can be used in a library function that can unroll loops.
- By giving this function a constant index of unroll factors, we can rapidly
check several unroll factors for a given loop, and choose the fastest one.

- Syntax for creating a range from an index/indices?
  - `nd::range(const index_base&, const index_base&)`
  - `nd::range(const index_base&)` is equivalent to the above function with a
  constant zero index as the first argument.

## Array Module

### Immediate TODO

- Notes:
  - Make `extents()` a public member variable called `ext`. This makes the
  syntax much nicer.
  - Subblock syntax for arrays: operator()(idx, idx) specifies the top-left
  corner and extents.
  - The extents of an array should be `index_base`.
  - Shorten names where appropriate, e.g. `dimension => dim`.
  - Comparison operations.
  - Implement arithmetic assignment operators (e.g. `+=`).
  - Decide on a syntax for array slices. Possibly use underscores: `a(0, _, 0, _) = ...`.

### Long-Term TODO

- Come up with the syntax to write loops using generic packets instead of the
same scalar type of the array. This would allow the loop operation to be
expressed using SIMD operations. Combined with the syntax for unrolling loops,
this can become very powerful.

- Support ranges in `operator()`, e.g. `a[i, end][c<3>, end - 1][c<2>, end, 2]`
- Use constexpr for arrays to implement compile-time arrays with the following
syntax:

  	using arr = "
		1 2 3
		4 5 6
		7 8 9
	"_array;

- To implement the constexpr versions of the functions for multidimensional
arrays, we can use essentially the same functions we use for non-constexpr
arrays: the bodies of the functions will all use non-constexpr statements
anyway.
- This makes the effort to implement compile-time multidimensional arrays
minimal.
